# Mechanical Design Optimization for FRC #
Here I will be crunching numbers and find solutions to design problems that work with the most uncertainty in their inputs.

**Python Libraries:**
- Matplotlib
- Numpy 
- Pandas

I have already used numpy ufuncs to speed up computation by a factor of 100.
However, problems and functions are relatively simple right now.
In the future, I might experiment with the **Numba** library and its ability to run calculations on **CUDA**-based GPUs.
Also need to build confidence working with the aforementioned libraries.
Will update progress.
